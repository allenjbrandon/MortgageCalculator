# MortgageCalculator

This mortgage calculator application was built to help users build a simple budget based on debt-to-income ratios and find overall house prices that fit those needs. 
The project itself consumes an api to receive the interest rate for the equations. It is done this way so that one can base the math on the current interest rates of the year.
